                After graduating from the University of Buenos aires, I worked
                in Accounting and as a Tax Advisor. However, I then decided I
                wanted to change my career so I took a break to travel around
                Europe.
              </p>

                While taking language courses and working in different cities, I
                learned how to code and discovered my new passion. In 2021 I
                enrolled in a 3 year vocational training program in Germany to
                become a Software Developer. I will graduate in July 2024.

              <p>
                When I am not coding, you can find me playing my guitar, making
                photos while traveling, hiking in the mountains or at some
                language exchange meetup somewhere in the world üåè.
